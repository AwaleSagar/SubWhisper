1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 Hey there, I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,799
 We're coming up to that time of year again

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,400
 when there are lots of events and celebrations.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,560
 That means lots of mingling,

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,000
 lots of chatting to people that you don't know

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,800
 and making small talk.

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,519
 It happens at work, at gatherings with friends

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,839
 or friends of friends and families of friends,

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,480
 neighbors, even people that you bump into in the lift.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,320
 We've got to practice these skills.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,200
 With small talk, we can build rapport with our colleagues,

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,479
 make new friends and just generally feel more positive

13
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,799
 about the interactions that we have with other people.

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,359
 So today, I'm gonna take you through 30 questions

15
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,640
 to make a small talk, to build the confidence

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,719
 to start conversations in English.

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,240
 But before I do, I wanna give a quick shout out

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,600
 to Lingoda who are sponsoring today's lesson.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,640
 If you want to overcome your fear of speech

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,359
 and you want to do it quickly,

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,480
 then you need to hear about the new three month challenges,

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,120
 the sprint and the supersprint.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,799
 Both of these new promotions help you to commit

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,540
 and take massive action to level up your language skills

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,840
 in just three months.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,159
 And both give you the chance to get a refund

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,640
 on the fees that you paid for your classes.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
 So what's the difference between the sprint

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,239
 and the supersprint?

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,959
 The sprint challenges you to take 15 classes a month

31
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,560
 for three months in a row.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,400
 Complete that and you get 50% refund on your course fees.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,040
 The supersprint challenges you to take 30 classes per month

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,079
 for three months.

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,079
 Complete that and you get 100% refund

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,439
 on your tuition fees.

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,840
 It's that simple.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,319
 I took the Lingoda Marathon

39
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,840
 and it was one of the best things that I've ever done.

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,439
 I practice my Spanish every day with native teachers

41
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,920
 and I earn real certifications.

42
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,000
 Lingoda is a quality language school

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,480
 which is of course why I recommend them to you.

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,920
 With small group classes available 24 seven,

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
 the flexibility is a huge plus.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,439
 The next sprints are happening from January to April.

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
 What a way to start a new year,

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
 especially if you end up getting that refund, right?

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,719
 So if you think you've got what it takes,

50
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,919
 secure your place by signing up by December 19th.

51
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,479
 You need to pay 49 euros as a deposit

52
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,360
 and if you use this code,

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,719
 you'll get 10 euros off that deposit.

54
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,919
 All the rules and event details are on the Lingoda website

55
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,719
 and of course I'll put the link to that

56
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,479
 in the description below.

57
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,639
 Small talk is an incredibly important function

58
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,479
 of English conversation.

59
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,759
 It's about comfort.

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,520
 It's about helping two people,

61
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,719
 you and the other person that you're talking to,

62
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,039
 to feel comfortable with each other.

63
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,840
 And the intention is to try and find some common interests,

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,080
 something that you can share together.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,280
 So I wanted to think of yourself as a detective.

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,759
 You're searching for some information and some clues

67
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,520
 to help you connect with someone,

68
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,639
 to find some common ground and share interests.

69
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,280
 A good way to approach small talk

70
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
 is to focus on a few broad categories.

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,120
 Work, life, travel, food and the weather.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,159
 Now I'm gonna go out on a limb here

73
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,159
 and say that about 90% of all small talk conversations

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,759
 focus on these topics, maybe even 95.

75
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,560
 But this is great because it allows us to focus

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,400
 on some really specific topics, right?

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,159
 And help you to prepare for conversations

78
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,759
 that you're very likely to actually experience.

79
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,240
 There's another thing that's useful

80
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,840
 to keep in mind with small talk and that's time.

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,360
 With all of these topics,

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,080
 we can ask questions that relate to the current situation.

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,759
 Now, any experience in the past

84
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,199
 or any future dreams or future plans, right?

85
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,439
 So pay close attention to the examples

86
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,759
 that I'm gonna share

87
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,919
 because I'll be using some different time references

88
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,400
 and any questions.

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,800
 So let's get started with 30 questions

90
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,159
 to help you master small talk conversations.

91
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,120
 Starting with work.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,560
 Now, the most common question here is, what do you do?

93
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,399
 So we're talking about now, what's their current job?

94
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,360
 Imagine that the person that you're talking to

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,959
 said they're a nurse.

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,279
 But we wanna ask some more detail, right?

97
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,560
 We wanna find out how they can continue the conversation.

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
 So let's go back in time.

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,199
 What motivated you to become a nurse?

100
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,160
 Did you always wanna be a nurse?

101
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,759
 What was your first ever job?

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,680
 Did you like it?

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
 We can talk about the present as well.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,439
 What does your typical workday look like?

105
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,040
 What do you love about your job?

106
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,879
 And you can get a little creative

107
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,040
 with some future questions as well.

108
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,839
 So is this your dream job?

109
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,040
 Are you working towards something else?

110
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,319
 I'm gonna be careful here that you don't say

111
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,240
 working towards something bigger or something better

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,879
 because it might be a little offensive, right?

113
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
 You're sort of saying that their job

114
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,439
 that they currently have isn't good enough.

115
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,720
 If money wasn't an issue, what job would you want?

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,279
 Some people might say that they don't wanna work

117
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,920
 if they didn't have any issues with money, right?

118
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,199
 But you might have to rephrase that question and say,

119
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,600
 well, what would you do?

120
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,759
 Or how would you spend your time?

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,959
 Another really great small talk topic

122
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,319
 is just talking about life.

123
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,160
 And there's a couple of ways that you can do this.

124
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,560
 You can pay attention to local news headlines.

125
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,279
 This is a really good way of finding things to talk about.

126
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,399
 Did you hear about the accident on the freeway last night?

127
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,519
 Sounded awful.

128
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,759
 I got stuck in traffic for over two hours.

129
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,639
 Albeit you might end up talking a lot

130
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,800
 about all of the negative stuff that was in your news, right?

131
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
 But you can also ask questions

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,360
 about what's happening in a person's life.

133
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,759
 So remember that your intention is to try and find

134
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,399
 some common interests, right?

135
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,639
 Some things that you share

136
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,439
 so that you can keep talking about those things together.

137
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,560
 Have you got much planned for the weekend?

138
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,560
 This is a great question.

139
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,759
 It's my go-to.

140
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,560
 Everyone loves talking about their plans on the weekend.

141
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,639
 What do you like to do in your spare time?

142
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,920
 Now, if they share something that you also like,

143
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,879
 that's great because you can keep talking

144
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,079
 about your shared interests.

145
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,399
 Or if they share something that you don't know anything about,

146
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,959
 ask them for more information.

147
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,720
 Oh, that's so interesting.

148
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
 I've never met anyone who keeps bees

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,519
 and makes their own honey.

150
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,680
 How much honey do you get each week?

151
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,639
 Have you ever been bitten by a bee?

152
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,959
 Is it easy to keep bees or do you have to be an expert?

153
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
 Have you read any good books lately?

154
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,120
 Have you seen any good movies?

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
 If you're a mom or you're a dad,

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,240
 you might even ask, so do you have any kids?

157
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,439
 Because this is a great way to connect with someone.

158
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,959
 Talk about your kids' ages, interests,

159
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,839
 maybe even their minority habits.

160
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,560
 Same thing with pets, actually.

161
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,720
 Have you noticed that I've been using so quite a bit

162
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,839
 to introduce a new idea to a conversation?

163
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,920
 This is really quite a natural way

164
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,240
 to introduce a new question.

165
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,040
 One that's unrelated to what you've been talking about

166
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,879
 previous, it's a really helpful conversation tool.

167
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,720
 So are you from here?

168
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,720
 This is a great question to help explore someone's past,

169
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,519
 go back in time.

170
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,199
 Where did you live before this?

171
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,839
 Is this city quite different to that city?

172
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,600
 Where did you grow up?

173
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,879
 Travel is a great small talk topic.

174
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,959
 It's something that we love talking about

175
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,519
 and we love sharing.

176
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,480
 So we can talk about our past experience

177
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,839
 or we can talk about travel plans

178
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,480
 and dreams for the future, right?

179
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,800
 If you're coming up to a holiday season,

180
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,360
 you're heading into summer,

181
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,800
 then a great conversation starter is,

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,920
 so are you planning on getting away for the holidays?

183
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,079
 Are you taking time off over Christmas?

184
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,039
 Or whatever holidays coming up?

185
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,240
 But if it's not that time of year,

186
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,440
 you can easily start a conversation

187
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,960
 by introducing some context, right?

188
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,000
 By sharing your experience first

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,759
 and then inviting their input.

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
 So I've just got back from the trip to Japan.

191
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
 Have you ever been?

192
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,320
 Or maybe you might know something about their experience.

193
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 You went to Peru last year, didn't you?

194
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,960
 I'm planning on taking my fiance to South America in June.

195
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,679
 It's our first time and I'm not really sure

196
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,519
 which countries we're going to visit.

197
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,320
 Do you have any recommendations?

198
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,600
 Do you have any recommendations

199
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,840
 about which country to visit in South America?

200
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,000
 I am thinking about a trip next year.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,039
 I love traveling.

202
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,440
 I hope to visit Kerala in the south of India

203
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
 at some point soon.

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 What places are on your bucket list?

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,200
 I'm actually really keen to hear your answers

206
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,919
 to this question.

207
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,879
 What places are on your bucket list?

208
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,279
 What places are you dreaming about visiting?

209
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,879
 Make sure you let me know in the comments.

210
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,080
 Just like travel, food is another great small talk topic.

211
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,360
 It's something that we all have in common.

212
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,159
 We do it at least three times a day.

213
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,440
 So there are plenty of opportunities

214
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,000
 to start a conversation about food.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,279
 I'm trying to decide where to go for lunch.

216
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,120
 Do you know any good restaurants around here?

217
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,080
 I'm cooking lasagna for dinner tonight.

218
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,919
 What about you?

219
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
 Hey, have you tried that new Thai restaurant

220
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,799
 on Church Street?

221
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,440
 That's amazing.

222
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,559
 Do you like Thai food?

223
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,720
 Now, I just can't leave weather off the list.

224
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,879
 This is the absolute number one small talk topic.

225
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,440
 It can be used as a simple passing comment, right?

226
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,279
 It's a beautiful day today, isn't it?

227
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,840
 Can you believe all the rain we've been having lately?

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,919
 But you can also use the weather as a way to spark a conversation

229
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,799
 by using it to introduce another topic or another activity.

230
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,039
 It's pouring out there.

231
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,799
 It's a shame I rode my bike today.

232
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,000
 How did you get to work?

233
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,159
 So there you have it.

234
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,240
 30 different questions,

235
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,519
 30 ways to start a conversation with small talk in English.

236
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,759
 Now, I'm going to set a little homework for you,

237
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,799
 a little challenge, okay?

238
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,840
 Because memorizing and practicing the questions

239
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,000
 that I've shared with you today is one thing.

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,240
 That's great practice.

241
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,960
 But of course, what you need is to be ready

242
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,679
 to answer those questions as well

243
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,679
 so that you can keep the conversation going.

244
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,240
 So your homework is to think of your own answers

245
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
 to these questions too.

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,879
 Once you ask them and then you hear the answer,

247
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,440
 you want to be ready with your own experiences

248
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,720
 and your own opinions to share, right?

249
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,080
 To keep the small talk going.

250
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,559
 If you'd like me to make some conversation workouts

251
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,399
 about each of these topics, just like this one,

252
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,279
 then make sure you tell me in the comments.

253
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,960
 That way we can practice asking questions

254
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,639
 and responding to them out loud together.

255
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,519
 We're going to focus on tone and pronunciation

256
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,639
 to help them come out really naturally.

257
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,759
 And don't forget to check out Lingoda.

258
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,879

259
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,879

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,559
 you can find me on Facebook and on Instagram.

262
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,639

263
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,679
 then come and check it out.

264
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,679
 This is where I share a little bit of personal stuff

265
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:06,360
 about my life and about the amazing people that are in it.

266
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,240
 If you're ready to keep practicing with me now,

267
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,440
 then come and check out these lessons here.

268
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840

 I'll see you in there.
